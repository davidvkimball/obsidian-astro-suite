# Starlight Theme Example

This is a preconfigured Vault CMS example for the [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) Astro documentation theme.

## How to Use This Example

1. **Copy the contents** of this folder (not the folder itself) into your Starlight theme project.
2. Paste them into your `src/content` folder.
   - ⚠️ **Important**: Copy the files and folders inside this folder (like `_bases/`, `docs/`, etc.) directly into `src/content/`, not the `Starlight` folder.
3. Open Obsidian and select "Open folder as vault", then select your `src/content` folder.
4. The vault is preconfigured for Starlight and ready to use!

## What's Included

This example includes:
- Preconfigured `.obsidian` settings optimized for Starlight
- Example content structure matching Starlight's expected format
- A `_bases/` folder with a Home base for content management
- A `docs/` folder with example documentation content

## Alternative: Use Starter Vault

If you prefer an adaptive vault that automatically detects your theme, use the **Starter Vault** from the root of this repository instead. It will work with Starlight and automatically configure itself.
